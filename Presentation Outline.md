## Heart Surgery May be Better in the Afternoon

​								**Mellow 11/21 2019**

### Warm up

Have you ever think of seeing a doctor in a different time of the day would have impact for you long-term recovery.

### Open-heart surgery in the afternoon experienced better health outcomes

- six years for observing nearly 600 patients who underwent heart valve replacement. 

- 500 days after surgery, open-heart surgery in the afternoon experienced better health outcomes

- myocardial infarction
- acute heart failure
- death

### Why is that happen? circadian rhythm

- circadian rhythm—the body’s internal clock

- randomized-controlled trial of 88 different patients who got the same surgery

- afternoon surgeries resulted in lower levels of myocardial ischaemia

- scheduling changes could decrease injury or death.

### Laboratory research

- isolated heart tissue from a subgroup of 30 patients 
- tissue from afternoon surgeries more quickly regained its ability to contract 
- 300 genes showed variation in their expression in heart tissue over the course of a day
- gene higher in the morning, much lower in the afternoon— Rev-Erbα. 
- artificially removed that gene in mice could recover from morning surgery

- Developing drugs about Rev-Erbα could therefore help protect human hearts during surgery.

### Other findings 

- [vaccines](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16301736) and [cancer treatments](http://www.oncologynurseadvisor.com/side-effect-management/chemotherapy-more-effective-when-synced-with-circadian-rhythm/article/504455/) affected by the time of day 
- could potentially save a lot of lives. It’s pretty critical

### Schedule your medical appointment 

Try to get to know your body's biological clock, the circadian rhythm, it's in every single cell of your body, it affects the biological activity of each cell type, commensurate with the function of those cells.
