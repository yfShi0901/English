## Why Heart Surgery May be Better in the Afternoon

### warm up

Hello everyone, I am Mellow, Tonight I will share a insteristiing topic about our body clock. and I am gonna started with a question, 

Have you ever schedule you medical appoinment or seeing a doctor in a specific time of the day?

like。。。 you always see you dentist in the morning?

 **Have you ever awere of/think of seeing a doctor in a different time of the day would have impact for you long-term recovery**.

### Operations after noon have fewer bad outcomes

Recently, A group from Lille University of France found **the time of day of your surgery could have long-term impacts on your health.** They spend  six years for observing nearly 600 patients who underwent heart valve replacement. 

Surprisingly, In the subsequent 500 days after surgery, they found, patients who underwent open-heart surgery in the afternoon experienced better health outcomes compared to those who got operated on in the morning.Those patients who had surgery after noon had **half risk of a major cardiac** event—for instance **myocardial infarction**, acute heart failure, or death—as those who had surgeries before then.

But, Why？and **How is that happening???** 

### Why is that happening?

The research team concluded that the circadian rhythm—the body’s internal clock—affects the outcomes of a patient recovering from a complex heart procedure. 

The leader of this team professor David suggests that is because part of the biological mechanism behind the damage is affected by a person’s circadian clock and the underlying genes that control it.” scheduling changes could decrease injury or death. Means differences in gene expression over the course of a day may cause a person’s heart to heal more quickly in the afternoon than in the morning.

The team also conducted a randomized-controlled trial of 88 different patients who got the same surgery, half in the morning and the other half in the afternoon. They found that afternoon surgeries resulted in lower levels of myocardial ischaemia（means ）–reperfusion injury—tissue damage that occurs when blood flows again through the repaired portion of the heart—than did morning surgeries. Experts say that sort of heart tissue injury can lead to higher risk of  long-term mortality. scheduling changes could decrease injury or death.



The researchers isolated heart tissue samples from a subgroup of 30 patients from the randomized controlled trial. In laboratory tests, tissue from afternoon surgeries more quickly regained its ability to contract when researchers imitated the process of the heart refilling with blood as surgery concludes. Additionally, researchers found that nearly 300 genes showed variation in their expression in heart tissue over the course of a day—a possible basis for the tissue’s change in behavior.

Finally, scientists wanted to test whether they could trick heart muscle into healing in an afternoon fashion regardless of time of day. To do this, they chose a gene that differed greatly in circadian expression—higher in the morning, much lower in the afternoon—called Rev-Erbα. They studied what happened in mouse hearts when they artificially removed that gene, either by editing it out of the genome or by giving mice a drug to block its effects. And researchers found that, indeed, mice given the drug, or with the gene removed, could recover from morning surgery (mice mornings being nighttime, since they are nocturnal) with fewer side effects than usual.

Developing drugs that modulate genes like Rev-Erbα could therefore help protect human hearts during surgery.

Nowdays, “There are few other surgical options to reduce the risk of post-surgery heart damage, So, new techniques to protect patients are needed,”

### Other findings

There are also other findings suggesting that time of day plays an important role in how well various medical treatments work. 

Like the efficacy of some [vaccines](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16301736) and [cancer treatments](http://www.oncologynurseadvisor.com/side-effect-management/chemotherapy-more-effective-when-synced-with-circadian-rhythm/article/504455/) may be affected by the time of day when a therapy is administered or medicine is taken. 

For example, research has found that patients who received a seasonal flu vaccination before 11 a.m. produced more antibodies than those who had one after 3 p.m.

“This kind of study underscores the importance of the circadian rhythm biology that’s finally starting to gain recognition in science,” said James Olcese, a biomedical sciences professor at Florida State University’s College of Medicine who was not involved in the study. “This could potentially save a lot of lives. It’s pretty critical, taking it beyond a basic concept of tissue all the way to the real-world scenario of surgeries occurring at different times of day.”
